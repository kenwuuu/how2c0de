My notes on learning web dev, November 2020. I feel like the web moves super fast so this may be outdated in 2-3 years, I'll try to keep it up to date as a resource for myself also but I'm bad with keeping up with thiings. 

## Context
I'm learning the MERN stack which is arguably the most popular stack right now. It's Mongo for the database, NodeJS and ExpressJS on the backend, and React as the frontend library. Also react-bootstrap on the frontend but the docs were simple enough for me so I won't write much about it.

NodeJS is the interpreter for JS on the backend and replaces other common languages like Java, Python, Ruby, PHP.

Express is the web framework for Node, much like Spring, Django or Flask, or Ruby on Rails.

Mongo is a noSQL database. 

## Assumptions
I assume basic familiarity with SQL databases, equivalent to maybe 30 minutes of watching a comprehensive SQL video on YouTube, and another 30 minutes of playing around with your own SQL database.

Proficiency with a programming language. Nothing is very complex but I'm assuming you can infer/google what terminal commands are doing and what each line in a file is doing.

Know what HTML and CSS are.

Basically, if you took AP CS or have written a basic program, and watched some videos on HTML/CSS and SQL, you should be good to go.

## Web Dev Structure
You have frontend/client/browser/user code, and backend/server code. You build those as usual, then connect them with API calls

## Setup
Make a new folder, eg "helloworld", this will be your main folder and git repo so put it somewhere familiar. Make two folders inside of that, "backend" and "frontend"

todo: write about routes
todo: explain what html and css is
