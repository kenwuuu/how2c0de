A personal teaching resource for helping people start learning new technologies from absolutely nothing.

I hate learning new technologies and I also like teaching so this is part personal notes and teaching notes, and part public learning resource if anyone even notices this. I pick new things to learn with very little background in the "why", and most quick start guides don't really tell you the "why" behind the technology or the "how", which is really important to my learning process. So this is gonna cover the stuff that I learn the hard way, quickly. Hopefully this can be a core resource but not the only thing used to learn new tech.

## Python

## NodeJS
This is an interpreter for JavaScript. JS used to only run on browsers, now we can run it outside of browsers like regular interpreted/compiled languages. This is nice because we can use a single language for web dev, and we can interchange code between the browser and the server.
It's literally just JavaScript. 

## React
A JS library 

## MongoDB

## Mongoose
Mongoose is a trash ass library that will modify what you type to break your code. It will pluralize your models/collections. Turn off mongoose pluralize, google how. 
Besides that, it's a nice MongoDB library
