A personal teaching resource for helping people start learning new technologies from absolutely nothing.

I hate learning new technologies and I also like teaching so this is part personal notes and teaching notes, and part public learning resource if anyone even notices this. I pick new things to learn with very little background in the "why", and most quick start guides don't really tell you the "why" behind the technology or the "how", which is really important to my learning process. So this is gonna cover the stuff that I learn the hard way, quickly. Hopefully this can be a core resource but not the only thing used to learn new tech.

It's literally just JavaScript.
